## Details:

This is my daily VR workout routine. I don't have a VR headset so I use the Kinect. I use a [script ](https://github.com/jandae/scriptsusefultome/blob/main/vr.ahk)to run the VR software, transfer the VR window to the TV and change the audio output



## What I learned:

* Not all USB extensions are created equal and USB has a limited distance (about 16 feet and 5 inches)

  * This [USB extension](https://imgur.com/XDjbMkm) (PHP 305) does not work


* A clone Switch controller doesn't necessarily work with PC even if the original can

  * [JYS-NS191](https://shopee.ph/product/21381370/3469953006?smtt=0.89058394-1628537782.5?smtt=0.89058394-1628537782.5) although works well if not better than the original does not work

    * Still hasn't found a use for it yet, but maybe it will be great if we buy a nintendo switch in the future, we could have more players with this
