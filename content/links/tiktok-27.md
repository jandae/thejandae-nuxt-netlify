## Items:

* RGB Strip light - [WS2812B 30/m](https://shp.ee/j9536ht) 
* DIY Controller - [Nodemcu unsoldered](https://shp.ee/uizq2rt): cheaper but would not recommend, as it doesnâ€™t work with the latest WLED (Ver 8.6 and up)
* [Non-DIY controlle](https://shp.ee/5pzfxmt)r
* [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) - easy setup with LED control support
