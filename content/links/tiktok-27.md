## Items:

* RGB Strip light - [WS2812B 30](https://shopee.ph/product/341931632/5767806837?smtt=0.89058394-1628294164.9)
* DIY Controller - [Nodemcu unsoldered](https://shopee.ph/product/20469516/1369052661): cheaper but would not recommend, as it doesnâ€™t work with the latest WLED (Ver 8.6 and up)
* [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) - easy setup with LED control support
