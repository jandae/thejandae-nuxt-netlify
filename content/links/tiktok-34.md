## Story:

This laptop for it's time was usable but been held back with Windows 8 which it came shipped with. The touch screen experience was not that good with that OS. With the update of Windows 8.1 it was a little better and much usable but by that time I was used to not using the touchscreen. As the years passed using this for video editing and programming it was very capable and was able to upgrade to Windows 10. By this time it started getting slow and hot. I decided to add more RAM to it from 4GB to 8GB which helped but the best upgrade I did was from HDD to SSD. This really helped with Windows 10 boot times and opening applications. 

The inside finish was a brushed metal feel which is pretty cool and looked premium, the outside was a rubbery matte texture. This was great for the first years or using it. But when I moved to a place where it was hot at the day time (I wasn't usually home). The texture became sticky and the screen rubber pads started to fall off. Fast forward to the pandemic I moved back to my family home and it was cooler and humid at that place. The back of the laptop started to have molds(?) or some white stuff. So in the future I'm planning on vinyl wrapping it white (The Flex 2 14 came out months after buying my laptop and it had a white option!)
