## Thoughts:

Makes it more quiet especially on wooden floors. Installation easy and tool-less as it just snaps in securely (I thought it was a bolt). Makes it more smooth when sliding and also more quiet. The chair is still rattly though, maybe grease will help with it. 

Iâ€™ll use the old wheels for my mic stand as I added weights to it which made it difficult to move.
