## Thoughts:

Makes it more quiet especially on wooden floors. Installation easy and tool-less as it just snaps in securely (I thought it was a bolt). Makes it more smooth when sliding and also more quiet. The chair is still rattly though, maybe grease will help with it. 

I’ll use the old wheels for my mic stand as I added weights to it which made it difficult to move.
