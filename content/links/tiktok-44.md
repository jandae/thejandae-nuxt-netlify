## Thoughts:

My room and desk space is small so this solved the problem for me. Installation was not that bad but I recommend having someone to hold it while you mark screw holes and mounting. It even has a bonus snack compartment ðŸ˜‚. Itâ€™s able to hold the weight of my arms while typing and overall seems sturdy enough. It could be wider for the mouse so I decided to replace it with wood soon, might look better (hopefully)
